# homeworkone code refactoring

## Description

Website of Horiseon optimize

I did code refactoring to improve the marketing webpage of Horiseon by using semantic elements(Can let the html page more clear for every element, so both user and developer can easily understand them). I made webpage nav bar all working right; optimize code for css and made comment.

## Installation 

Upload folder to deployed webserver-github. 

## Usage

When users view the webpage, they can use nav bar to guide them to different sections.  [screenshot](./assets/images/screenshot.png)
